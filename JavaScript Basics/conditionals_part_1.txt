My prediction is that lines 7, 15, and 19 will be output because the preceding conditional lines for each will be truthy. So 'Hello', 'World', '!' should be output.

myString points to a string which is not empty, so it is truthy; however, since it's being negated on line 10, the overall conditional expression is falsey and thus line 11 will not be output.
