This code will log 'Bob Bob'. 

The invocation of toUpperCase() on line 3 doesn't mutate the string, and no reassignment takes place. Thus, both name and saveName reference the string 'Bob' and that's output twice.

Further Exploration: All primitives have object wrappers available, which is why the primitive string value can invoke the String.prototype.toUpperCase() method.
