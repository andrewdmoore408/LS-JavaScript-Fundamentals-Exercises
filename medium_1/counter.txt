1. This will log 'The total value is 15'. The function declaration for function counter will be hoisted above the variable declarations, and thus counter will be reassigned to 5. Since 5 * 3 is 15, that will be interpolated into the string and then output.

2. This will output 'The total value is NaN', because the rate variable has not yet been initialized when the counter * rate expression is evaluated and so rate will evaluate to undefined and the entire expression will evaluate to NaN.

3. This will output 'The total value is 15'. The variable called counter will again be reassigned to 5 after the function declaration has been hoisted, and so 5 * 3 will evaluate to 15 and then be output using string interpolation.

4. This will output a SyntaxError. A let/const variable and function name can't be the same.
