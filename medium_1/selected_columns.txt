The problem is that both for loops are using a variable named length. After the inner for loop first runs, the value of length is being changed to match the length of the array assigned to the local variable cols inside the function, so the number of rows returned is being cut short to the length of the cols array rather than the length of the array assigned to local variable numbers.
