This code will not produce its expected result.

Since local variable sum isn't explicitly initialized, it will point to undefined, so attempting to reassign it to its own value plus a number will result in it being assigned to NaN.

In addition, there's no explicit return at the end of the function body, so even if the sum were being calculated properly, it wouldn't be returned from the total function.
